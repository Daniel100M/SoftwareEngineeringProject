# Flask Blog

This is a Flask-based web application designed for a blog and food ordering system. It allows users to register, login, and interact with posts and food dishes. There are two types of users: customers and restaurant owners. Customers can browse restaurants, place orders, and manage their accounts, while restaurant owners can manage dishes and view orders.

## Usage

- **Register**: Create a new user account.
- **Login**: Log in to an existing account.
- **Home**: View posts (for customers) or manage dishes (for restaurant owners).
- **Account**: Update account information and profile picture.
- **Orders**: Place orders (for customers) or view/manage orders (for restaurant owners).
- **Load Money**: Load money to the customer's account.
